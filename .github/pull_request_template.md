#### Ensure you are a Patron

To be using Fody you should be a [Patron](https://opencollective.com/fody/order/3059). See [Licensing/Patron FAQ](https://github.com/Fody/Fody#licensingpatron-faq). With that requirement in mind, it is assumed anyone raising a PR is already a Patron.  As such your GitHub user name may be verified against the [OpenCollective contributors](https://opencollective.com/fody#contributors). This verification will depend on the PR quality, your circumstances, and the impact on the larger Fody user base.

Even if the feature is a good idea and viable, it may not be accepted since the ongoing effort in maintaining the feature may outweigh the benefit it delivers.
