### This is an add-in for [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody/) 

Embeds dependencies as resources.

## How it works

### Merge assemblies as embedded resources.

This approach uses a combination of two methods

 * Jeffrey Richter's suggestion of using [embedded resources as a method of merging assemblies](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2010/02/03/jeffrey-richter-excerpt-2-from-clr-via-c-third-edition.aspx)
 * Einar Egilsson's suggestion [using cecil to create module initializers](http://tech.einaregilsson.com/2009/12/16/module-initializers-in-csharp/)

### Details 

This Task performs the following changes

 * Take all assemblies (and pdbs) that have been marked as "Copy Local" and embed them as resources in the target assembly.
 * Injects the following code into the module initializer of the target assembly. This code will be called when the assembly is loaded into memory

eg 

    static <Module>()
    {
        ILTemplate.Attach();
    }

 * Injects the following class into the target assembly. This means if an assembly load fails it will be loaded from the embedded resources.

  - [ILTemplate.cs](https://github.com/Fody/Costura/blob/master/Template/ILTemplate.cs)
  - [ILTemplateWithTempAssembly.cs](https://github.com/Fody/Costura/blob/master/Template/ILTemplateWithTempAssembly.cs)

## Configuration Options

All config options are access by modifying the `Costura` node in FodyWeavers.xml

### CreateTemporaryAssemblies

This will copy embedded files to disk before loading them into memory. This is helpful for some scenarios that expected an assembly to be loaded from a physical file.

*Defaults to `false`*

    <Costura CreateTemporaryAssemblies='true' />
    
### IncludeDebugSymbols

Controls if .pdbs for reference assemblies are also embedded.

*Defaults to `true`*

    <Costura IncludeDebugSymbols='false' />

### DisableCompression

Embedded assemblies are compressed by default, and uncompressed when they are loaded. You can turn compression off with this option.

*Defaults to `false`*

    <Costura DisableCompression='false' />
	
### DisableCompression

When an assembly which is embedded is present on the disk it is loaded by default. You can turn disk assembly loading off with this option.

*Defaults to `true`*

    <Costura LoadExistingAssemblyFromDisk='false' />	
    
### ExcludeAssemblies

A list of assembly names to exclude from the default action of "embed all Copy Local references".

Do not include `.exe` or `.dll` in the names.

Can not be defined with `IncludeAssemblies`.

Can take two forms. 

As an element with items delimited by a newline.

    <Costura>
        <ExcludeAssemblies>
            Foo
            Bar
        </ExcludeAssemblies>
    </Costura>
    
Or as a attribute with items delimited by a pipe `|`.

    <Costura ExcludeAssemblies='Foo|Bar' />
    
        
### IncludeAssemblies

A list of assembly names to include from the default action of "embed all Copy Local references".

Do not include `.exe` or `.dll` in the names.

Can not be defined with `ExcludeAssemblies`.

Can take two forms. 

As an element with items delimited by a newline.

    <Costura>
        <IncludeAssemblies>
            Foo
            Bar
        </IncludeAssemblies>
    </Costura>
    
Or as a attribute with items delimited by a pipe `|`.

    <Costura IncludeAssemblies='Foo|Bar' />


### Unmanaged32Assemblies & Unmanaged64Assemblies

Mixed-mode assemblies cannot be loaded the same way as managed assemblies.

Therefore, to help Costura identify which assemblies are mixed-mode, and in what environment to load them in you should include their names in one or both of these lists.

Do not include `.exe` or `.dll` in the names.

Can take two forms. 

As an element with items delimited by a newline.

    <Costura>
        <Unmanaged32Assemblies>
            Foo32
            Bar32
        </Unmanaged32Assemblies>
        <Unmanaged64Assemblies>
            Foo64
            Bar64
        </Unmanaged64Assemblies>
    </Costura>
    
Or as a attribute with items delimited by a pipe `|`.

    <Costura 
        Unmanaged32Assemblies='Foo32|Bar32' 
        Unmanaged64Assemblies='Foo64|Bar64' />

### Native Libraries and PreloadOrder

Native libraries can be loaded by Costura automatically. To include a native library include it in your project as an Embedded Resource in a folder called `costura32` or `costura64` depending on the bittyness of the library.

Optionally you can also specify the order that preloaded libraries are loaded. When using temporary assemblies from disk mixed mode assemblies are also preloaded.

To specify the order of preloaded assemblies add a `PreloadOrder` element to the config.

    <Costura>
	    <PreloadOrder>
		    Foo
		    Bar
		</PreloadOrder>
	</Costura>

Or as a attribute with items delimited by a pipe `|`.

    <Costura PreloadOrder='Foo|Bar' />

## Creating a clean output directory

Costura only merges dependencies. It does not handle cleaning those dependencies from your output directory. So this means the resultant merged dll/exe will exist in your output directory (eg `bin\Debug`) next to all your dependencies. If you want to clean this directory you can add the following to your project file.

    <Target 
        AfterTargets="AfterBuild;NonWinFodyTarget"
        Name="CleanReferenceCopyLocalPaths" >
         <Delete Files="@(ReferenceCopyLocalPaths->'$(OutDir)%(DestinationSubDirectory)%(Filename)%(Extension)')" />
    </Target>

There is also a powershell cmdlet to install this target into your project automatically. In the Package Manager Console type:

    PM> Install-CleanReferencesTarget

Note that this does not handle `ExcludeAssemblies` or `IncludeAssemblies` options mentioned above. You will have to handle these explicitly.
